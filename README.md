# CPP

I'm too lazy to write a lexer, and this cpp is unfinished due to many reasons.
When I realized it's impossible to write a standard compliant preprocessor in
one day I gave up implementing a lexer but turn to the ugly regex for dirty hacks. 
I ruled that stupid part out the repo. I guess I'll never pick up this project
again, but who knows? :-)
